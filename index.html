        <p>
            I am a research scientist at <a href="https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/" target="_blank">Meta Reality Labs</a> in London.
            I received my PhD from the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at the University of Washington.

            <!-- In the past, I have been fortunate to have worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/index.html">Emily Fox</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/">Zaid Harchaoui</a>. -->

            In the past, I have had the pleasure of interning at <a target="_blank" href="https://research.google/">Google Research</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/">NVIDIA Research</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft</a>.

            I was graciously supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (<a href="https://ndseg.asee.org/">NDSEG</a>) Fellowship.
              
            I completed my undergraduate studies at University of California, Berkeley, in the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">EECS department</a>.

            My interests span the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. In particular, I am interested in investigating visual representations that enable robots to perform physical tasks such as object manipulation in unstructured and cluttered scenes.

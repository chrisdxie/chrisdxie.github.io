        <p>I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/">Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at the University of Washington. I am currently working with <a target="_blank" href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/">Dieter Fox</a>. In the past, I have been fortunate to have worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/index.html">Emily Fox</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/">Zaid Harchaoui</a>.
        
        I am interested in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics.
        
        I completed my undergraduate studies at University of California, Berkeley, in the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">EECS department</a>.

        <p> I am currently supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (<a href="https://ndseg.asee.org/">NDSEG</a>) Fellowship. </p>

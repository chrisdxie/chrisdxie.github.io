            I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/">Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at the University of Washington, currently working with <a target="_blank" href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/">Dieter Fox</a>. Currently, I am also a student researcher at <a target="_blank" href="https://research.google/">Google Research</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the past, I have been fortunate to have worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/index.html">Emily Fox</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/">Zaid Harchaoui</a>.

            I was graciously supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (<a href="https://ndseg.asee.org/">NDSEG</a>) Fellowship from 2016-2019.
              
            I completed my undergraduate studies at University of California, Berkeley, in the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">EECS department</a>.

            My interests span the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. In particular, I am interested in investigating visual representations that enable robots to perform physical tasks such as object manipulation in unstructured and cluttered scenes.
